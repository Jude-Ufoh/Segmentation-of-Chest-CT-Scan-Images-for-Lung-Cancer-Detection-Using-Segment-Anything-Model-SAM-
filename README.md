# Segmentation-of-Chest-CT-Scan-Images-for-Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-Segment-Anything-Model-SAM-
## Overview
The project evaluates the efficacy of Segment Anything Model (SAM) in segmenting a set of chest CT scan images.
SAM is a foundation model in the field of computer vision developed by the Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)
SAM employs a unique two-stage methodology in
which the input image is first encoded into a high-dimensional embedding before the
embedding and input prompt are used to generate object masks. This methodology
allows SAM to perform zero shot learning on a set of data and to accept and process
complex input prompts with different objects and attributes.

Three different methods of segmentation using SAM model were applied on the images
to segment out the lung region. The segmented lung region was further used to build a
deep learning classification model that can identify different types of lung cancer.
